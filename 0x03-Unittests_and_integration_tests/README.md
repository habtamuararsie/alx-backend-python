Learning ObjectivesðŸ’¡
What you should learn from this project:

0. Parameterize a unit test
Familiarize yourself with the utils.access_nested_map function and understand its purpose. Play with it in the Python console to make sure you understand.
1. Parameterize a unit test
Implement TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map_exception. Use the assertRaises context manager to test that a KeyError is raised for the following inputs (use @parametrized.expand):
2. Mock HTTP calls
Familiarize yourself with the utils.get_json function.
3. Parameterize and patch
Read about memoization and familiarize yourself with the utils.memoize decorator.
4. Parameterize and patch as decorators
Familiarize yourself with the client.GithubOrgClient class.
5. Mocking a property
memoize turns methods into properties. Read up on how to mock a property (see resource).
6. More patching
Implement TestGithubOrgClient.test_public_repos to unit-test GithubOrgClient.public_repos.
7. Parameterize
Implement TestGithubOrgClient.test_has_license to unit-test GithubOrgClient.has_license.
8. Integration test: fixtures
We want to test the GithubOrgClient.public_repos method in an integration test. That means that we will only mock code that sends external requests.
